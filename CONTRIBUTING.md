# Contribution Guide

The project is build with Gradle and written in Java 8.

To start working on it simply clone and run `./gradlew build`. See the section [below](#Eclipse) on building and editing with Eclipse for step-by-step instructions.

# ECA

In order to contribute code, you need to sign an Eclipse Contributor Agreement, using the e-mail used at Github.
See https://eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php for details

# GitHub Pull Requests

All GitHub Pull Requests run the following checks.

## eclipsefdn/eca

All Pull Requests must be by authors who have signed the ECA. The "ip-validation" status check on GitHub will check this.

## Jenkins PR Build

The [Jenkins CI job](https://ci.eclipse.org/lsp4j/job/lsp4j-github-pullrequests/) builds and tests pull requests. All member of the [GitHub Eclipse organisation](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse/people) should have their PRs built automatically as the whole organisation is on the whitelist. All other PRs need to be approved before they are built for the first time. To approve a PR you have to be an admin and say:

* "run tests" to accept this pull request for testing
* "test this please" for a one time test run
* "add to whitelist" to add the author to the whitelist

If the build fails for other various reasons you can rebuild.

* "retest this please" to start a new build

See full documentation for the [GitHub Pull Request plug-in for Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+pull+request+builder+plugin). To see the current list of Admins, visit the [configuration](https://ci.eclipse.org/lsp4j/job/lsp4j-github-pullrequests/configure) -> Build Triggers -> GitHub Pull Request Builder -> Admin list. All LSP4J committers can add their GitHub username to that list.

The Pull Request Builder polls the GitHub repo at 5 minute intervals, so there may be a short delay before the check shows up as Pending on GitHub.

# Eclipse

To develop with Eclipse this is the recommended flow:

1. Using the latest [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) install a Java development environment that contains these features. These are all available in the "Install New Software" under the name of the release you are using (e.g. Oxygen)
- JDT The Java Development Tools
- The latest Buildship plugin  (>= 2.\*) 
  - The LSP4J build is gradle based
- Xtend IDE
  - Much of the code and tests are written in [Xtend](https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/)

2. Fork/Clone the LSP4J repository

3. Import the root of LSP4J as a Gradle project:
  - File -> Import
  - Existing Gradle Project
  - Select the root of the cloned directory as "Project root directory"
  - Finish the wizard - this will import all the projects but there will be lots of errors. Complete the following steps before trying to resolve them.

4. Run the "eclipse assemble" gradle targets.
  - There is already a launch configuration in the root of the repository called "lsp4j-build-gradle", run it.
  - Doing this will generate the missing files and update the project configurations
  - There still may be errors in your workspace at this point. Complete the following steps before trying to resolve them.

5. Refresh the lsp4j projects.
  - This step is not needed if you have the "Refresh using native hooks or polling" setting (in Preferences -> General -> Workspace) enabled.
  - There still may be errors in your workspace at this point. Complete the following steps before trying to resolve them.

6. Clean the projects
  - Project menu -> Clean...
  - Select all the lsp4j projects

- If there are still errors in the LSP4J projects at this point, try the following:
  - try cleaning the LSP4J projects again, except the `org.eclipse.lsp4j.generator` project
    - This seems to happen because sometimes it looks like there may be a race condtion with the generator being built and the projects that depend on them
  - try restarting the IDE
    - This seems to happen because sometimes Buildship plug-ins don't remove previously created Error markers, but restarting clears them
  - If you can reliably reproduce one of the above cases, then it would be great to file a bug report with the projects that provide the corresponding Eclipse plug-ins (e.g. Xtend, Buildship, JDT)

Edit the `.xtend` files, not the files in `xtend-gen` directories. If you are in a Java file within the xtend-gen directory, right click and choose "Open Generated File".

The `org.eclipse.lsp4j.generator` project is used by the Xtend generator as an additional processor to contribute to the generated Java files. For example, the generator uses the `@JsonRpcData` annotation to convert the Xtend file and add things like `equals`, `toString`, `hashCode`.

Run the tests as you would run any normal JUnit tests (There is no need to run them as JUnit Plug-in Tests).
